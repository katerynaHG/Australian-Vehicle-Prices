## Data Collection
Data is compiled from online marketplaces like Carsales, Gumtree, and Drive, auction sites such as Pickles and Manheim, and official car manufacturer websites. These sources provide a robust representation of both the new and used car markets through the listings they host.

## Data Limitations
While extensive, the dataset mainly represents online listings and may not capture all market segments, such as offline and private sales. It relies on seller-reported information, which may not always be accurate. The dataset focuses on 2023, excluding historical and future trends, and does not account for the vehicle's condition, regional pricing differences, or the final sale price. The relevance of this data may decline as the market evolves, particularly with the rise of electric vehicles.

## Data Ethics
Data management practices should ensure anonymization to protect privacy, strive for accuracy, and maintain transparency about data origins and collection methods. It is important to prevent any potential discrimination and secure the data against unauthorized access, promoting fair use and avoiding market manipulation. Ethical use of this data should aim to benefit consumers and positively contribute to the automotive market.
